The package geotrans provides CMake targets:

    find_package(geotrans CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE geotrans::MSPdtcc geotrans::MSPCoordinateConversionService)


The geotrans library depends on being able to read it's model data so you'll need to
set an environment variable to let geotrans know where the models are installed:

export MSPCCS_DATA=@CURRENT_INSTALLED_DIR@/share/@PORT@/data
