The package promise-cpp is header only and can be used from CMake via:

    find_path(PROMISE_CPP_INCLUDE_DIRS "promise-cpp/promise.hpp")
    target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${PROMISE_CPP_INCLUDE_DIRS})

Make sure to define the pre-processor macro PROMISE_HEADONLY before including "promise-cpp/promise.hpp":

    #define PROMISE_HEADONLY
    #include "promise-cpp/promise.hpp"
