The package FakeIt provides CMake targets:

    # Usage for specific framework tests (e.g. boost, catch, gtest, etc.)
    find_package(FakeIt CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE FakeIt::FakeIt-<framework>)

    # Only specific test framework configuration files are provided upstream.
    # It does not install its own source header files.
    # So only the usage of the test framework is provided here.
