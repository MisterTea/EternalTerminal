Warning: Static TensorFlow build contains several external dependencies that may cause linking conflicts
    (for example, one cannot use both openssl and TensorFlow in the same project, since TensorFlow contains boringssl).

Note: Besides TensorFlow itself, you'll also need to pass its dependencies to the linker:
    * CoreFoundation
    * Security (only when linking against the whole library, see below)
for example, '-ltensorflow_cc -framework CoreFoundation -framework Security'.

Note: There is no separate libtensorflow_framework.a as it got merged into libtensorflow_cc.a to avoid linking conflicts.

Note: For some TensorFlow features (e.g. OpRegistry), it might be necessary to tell the linker to include the whole library:
    '-Wl,-force_load,path/to/libtensorflow_cc.a [rest of linker arguments]'
