The package OpenVINO can be used in cmake scripts as:

    find_package(OpenVINO REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE openvino::runtime)

Note: static build of Intel GPU plugin disables usage of oneDNN for GPU, which is important
for decent performance on discrete GPU devices. If you want to levarage performance of dGPU,
please, consider either option:
- Building with 'VCPKG_LIBRARY_LINKAGE=dynamic'
- Disable Intel CPU plugin, because it uses different oneDNN flavor
