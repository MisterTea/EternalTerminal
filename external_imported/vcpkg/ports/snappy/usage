snappy provides CMake targets:

    find_package(Snappy CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Snappy::snappy)

Optimizations based on hardware support are disabled by default.
You can enable them by adding corresponding flags to VCPKG_CMAKE_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS inside a custom triplet file, for example:

    if("${PORT}" STREQUAL "snappy")
        list(APPEND VCPKG_CMAKE_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS -DSNAPPY_HAVE_SSSE3=ON -DSNAPPY_HAVE_BMI2=ON)
    endif()

For a full list of possible options, see project's root CMakeLists.txt.
