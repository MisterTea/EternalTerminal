libyuv provides CMake targets:

    find_package(libyuv CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE yuv)

    # WARNING
    # You are using MSVC to compile libyuv, which results in a very slow library.
    # MSVC won't compile any of the acceleration codes.
    # See workarounds: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/28446
