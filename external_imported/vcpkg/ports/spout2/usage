spout2 provides CMake targets:

    # Dynamic Linkage
    find_package(Spout2 CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Spout2::Spout)

    # Static Linkage
    find_package(Spout2 CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Spout2::Spout_static)

    # SpoutLibrary
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Spout2::SpoutLibrary)

    # SpoutDX
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Spout2::SpoutDX)

    Note: SpoutDX (`dx` feature) is not essential to use DirectX in Spout... It is a sub-set of the
          Spout SDK for applications using DirectX rather than OpenGL. It doesn't mean enabling
          DirectX ability for Spout. See https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2/tree/master/SPOUTSDK
          It is more likely: 'Use only DirectX to implement Spout, and remove all codes that need OpenGL'.
