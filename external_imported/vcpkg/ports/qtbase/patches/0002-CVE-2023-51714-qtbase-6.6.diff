Subject: [PATCH] HPack: fix incorrect integer overflow check

This code never worked:

For the comparison with max() - 32 to trigger, on 32-bit platforms (or
Qt 5) signed interger overflow would have had to happen in the
addition of the two sizes. The compiler can therefore remove the
overflow check as dead code.

On Qt 6 and 64-bit platforms, the signed integer addition would be
very unlikely to overflow, but the following truncation to uint32
would yield the correct result only in a narrow 32-value window just
below UINT_MAX, if even that.

Fix by using the proper tool, qAddOverflow.

Pick-to: 6.5 6.2 5.15
