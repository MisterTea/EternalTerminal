  //! This method performs red zone calculation for CalculateStackRegion(). Its

  //!
  //! Where a red zone is required, the region of memory captured for a thread’s

  //!     red zone.
  //! \param[in,out] region_base The base address of the region that contains
  //!     stack memory. This is distinct from \a start_address in that \a
  //!     region_base will be page-aligned. On entry, \a region_base is the
  //!     base address of a region that contains \a start_address. On return,
  //!     if \a start_address is decremented and is outside of the region
  //!     originally described by \a region_base, \a region_base will also be
  //!     decremented appropriately.
  //! \param[in,out] region_size The size of the region that contains stack
  //!     memory. This region begins at \a region_base. On return, if \a
  //!     region_base is decremented, \a region_size will be incremented
  //!     appropriately.
  //! \param[in] user_tag The Mach VM system’s user tag for the region described
  //!     by the initial values of \a region_base and \a region_size. The red
  //!     zone will only be allowed to extend out of the region described by
