//! \brief Determines whether a module appears to be a malformed OpenCL
//!     `cl_kernels` module based on its name and Mach-O file type.
//!
//! `cl_kernels` modules require special handling because they’re malformed on
//! OS X 10.10 and later. A `cl_kernels` module always has Mach-O type
//! `MH_BUNDLE` and is named `"cl_kernels"` until macOS 10.14, and
//! `"/private/var/db/CVMS/cvmsCodeSignObj"` plus 16 random characters on macOS
//! 10.14.
//!
//! Malformed `cl_kernels` modules have a single `__TEXT` segment, but one of
//! the sections within it claims to belong to the `__LD` segment. This mismatch
//! shouldn’t happen. This errant section also has the `S_ATTR_DEBUG` flag set,
//! which shouldn’t happen unless all of the other sections in the segment also
//! have this bit set (they don’t). These odd sections are reminiscent of unwind
//! information stored in `MH_OBJECT` images, although `cl_kernels` images claim
//! to be `MH_BUNDLE`.
//!
//! These `cl_kernels` modules have only been observed on x86, not on arm64.
//! This function always returns `false` on arm64.
//!
//! This function is exposed for testing purposes only.
//!
//! \param[in] mach_o_file_type The Mach-O type of the module being examined.
//! \param[in] module_name The pathname that `dyld` reported having loaded the
//!     module from.
//! \param[out] has_timestamp Optional, may be `nullptr`. If provided, and the
//!     module is a maformed `cl_kernels` module, this will be set to `true` if
//!     the module was loaded from the filesystem (as is the case when loaded
//!     from the CVMS directory) and is expected to have a timestamp, and
//!     `false` otherwise. Note that even when loaded from the filesystem, these
//!     modules are unlinked from the filesystem after loading.
//!
//! \return `true` if the module appears to be a malformed `cl_kernels` module
//!     based on the provided information, `false` otherwise.

  //!
  //! This method must only be called once on an object. This method must be
  //! called successfully before any other method in this class may be called.
  //!
  //! \param[in] process_reader The reader for the remote process.
  //! \param[in] load_command_address The address, in the remote process’
  //!     address space, where the `LC_SEGMENT` or `LC_SEGMENT_64` load command
  //!     to be read is located. This address is determined by a Mach-O image
  //!     reader, such as MachOImageReader, as it walks Mach-O load commands.
  //! \param[in] load_command_info A string to be used in logged messages. This
  //!     string is for diagnostic purposes only, and may be empty.
  //! \param[in] module_name The path used to load the module. This string is
  //!     used to relax otherwise strict parsing rules for common modules with
  //!     known defects.
  //! \param[in] file_type The module’s Mach-O file type. This is used to relax
  //!     otherwise strict parsing rules for common modules with known defects.
  //!
  //! \return `true` if the load command was read successfully. `false`
  //!     otherwise, with an appropriate message logged.

  //! GetSectionByName(), or GetSectionAtIndex() can be called.
  //!
  //! This method is provided because slide is a property of the image that
  //! cannot be determined until at least some segments have been read. As such,
  //! it is not necessarily known at the time that Initialize() is called.
  void SetSlide(mach_vm_size_t slide);

  //! \brief Returns the segment’s name.
  //!
  //! The segment’s name is taken from the load command’s `segname` field.

  //!     when the image was loaded. Use Address() for a value adjusted for

  mach_vm_address_t vmaddr() const { return segment_command_.vmaddr; }

  //! \brief Returns the segment’s size as mapped into memory.

  mach_vm_size_t vmsize() const { return segment_command_.vmsize; }

  //! \brief Returns the file offset of the mapped segment in the file from
  //!     which it was mapped.
  //!
  //! The file offset is the difference between the beginning of the
  //! `mach_header` or `mach_header_64` and the beginning of the segment’s
  //! mapped region. For segments that are not mapped from a file (such as
  //! `__PAGEZERO` segments), this will be `0`.
  mach_vm_size_t fileoff() const { return segment_command_.fileoff; }

  //! \brief Returns the number of sections in the segment.
  //!
  //! This will return `0` for a segment without any sections, typical for
  //! `__PAGEZERO` and `__LINKEDIT` segments.
  //!
  //! Although the Mach-O file format uses a `uint32_t` for this field, there is
  //! an overall limit of 255 sections in an entire Mach-O image file (not just
  //! in a single segment) imposed by the symbol table format. Symbols will not
  //! be able to reference anything in a section beyond the first 255 in a
  //! Mach-O image file.
  uint32_t nsects() const { return segment_command_.nsects; }

  //! \brief Obtain section information by section name.
  //!
  //! \param[in] section_name The name of the section to search for, without the
  //!     leading segment name. For example, use `"__text"`, not
  //!     `"__TEXT,__text"` or `"__TEXT.__text"`.
  //! \param[out] address The actual address that the section was loaded at in
  //!     memory, taking any “slide” into account if the section did not load at
  //!     its preferred address as stored in the Mach-O image file. This
  //!     parameter can be `nullptr`.
  //!
  //! \return A pointer to the section information if it was found, or `nullptr`
  //!     if it was not found. The caller does not take ownership; the lifetime
  //!     of the returned object is scoped to the lifetime of this
  //!     MachOImageSegmentReader object.
  //!
  //! \note The process_types::section::addr field gives the section’s preferred
  //!     load address as stored in the Mach-O image file, and is not adjusted
  //!     for any “slide” that may have occurred when the image was loaded.

  const process_types::section* GetSectionByName(
      const std::string& section_name,
      mach_vm_address_t* address) const;

  //! \brief Obtain section information by section index.
  //!
  //! \param[in] index The index of the section to return, in the order that it
  //!     appears in the segment load command. Unlike
  //!     MachOImageReader::GetSectionAtIndex(), this is a 0-based index. This
  //!     parameter must be in the range of valid indices aas reported by
  //!     nsects().
  //! \param[out] address The actual address that the section was loaded at in
  //!     memory, taking any “slide” into account if the section did not load at
  //!     its preferred address as stored in the Mach-O image file. This
  //!     parameter can be `nullptr`.
  //!
  //! \return A pointer to the section information. If \a index is out of range,
  //!     execution is aborted.  The caller does not take ownership; the
  //!     lifetime of the returned object is scoped to the lifetime of this
  //!     MachOImageSegmentReader object.
  //!
  //! \note The process_types::section::addr field gives the section’s preferred
  //!     load address as stored in the Mach-O image file, and is not adjusted
  //!     for any “slide” that may have occurred when the image was loaded.
  //! \note Unlike MachOImageReader::GetSectionAtIndex(), this method does not
  //!     accept out-of-range values for \a index, and aborts execution instead
  //!     of returning `nullptr` upon encountering an out-of-range value. This
  //!     is because this method is expected to be used in a loop that can be
  //!     limited to nsects() iterations, so an out-of-range error can be
  //!     treated more harshly as a logic error, as opposed to a data error.
  //!
  //! \sa MachOImageReader::GetSectionAtIndex()
  const process_types::section* GetSectionAtIndex(
      size_t index,
      mach_vm_address_t* address) const;

  //! Returns whether the segment slides.
  //!
  //! Most segments slide, but the `__PAGEZERO` segment does not, it grows
  //! instead. This method identifies non-sliding segments in the same way that
  //! the kernel does.
  bool SegmentSlides() const;

  //! \brief Returns a segment name string.
  //!
  //! Segment names may be 16 characters long, and are not necessarily
  //! `NUL`-terminated. This function will return a segment name based on up to
  //! the first 16 characters found at \a segment_name_c.

  //! the first 16 characters found at \a section_name_c.
  static std::string SectionNameString(const char* section_name_c);

  //! \brief Returns a segment and section name string.
  //!
  //! A segment and section name string is composed of a segment name string

  //! `"__TEXT,__text"`.
