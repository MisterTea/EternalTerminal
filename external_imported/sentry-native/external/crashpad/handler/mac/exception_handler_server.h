  //! \param[in] exception_interface An object to send exception messages to.
  //!
  //! This method monitors the receive port for exception messages and, if
  //! not being run by launchd, no-senders notifications. It continues running
  //! until it has no more clients, indicated by the receipt of a no-senders
  //! notification, or until Stop() is called. When not being run by launchd, it
  //! is important to assure that a send right exists in a client (or has been
  //! queued by `mach_msg()` to be sent to a client) prior to calling this
  //! method, or it will detect that it is sender-less and return immediately.
  //!
  //! All exception messages will be passed to \a exception_interface.
  //!
  //! This method must only be called once on an ExceptionHandlerServer object.
  //!
  //! If an unexpected condition that prevents this method from functioning is
  //! encountered, it will log a message and terminate execution. Receipt of an
  //! invalid message on the receive port will cause a message to be logged, but
  //! this method will continue running normally.
  void Run(UniversalMachExcServer::Interface* exception_interface);

  //! \brief Stops a running exception-handling server.
  //!
  //! Stop() may be called at any time, and may be called from a signal handler.
  //! If Stop() is called before Run() it will cause Run() to return as soon as
  //! it is called. It is harmless to call Stop() after Run() has already
  //! returned, or to call Stop() after it has already been called.
