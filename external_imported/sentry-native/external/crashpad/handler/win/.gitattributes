# This should be a .cc file, which would allow its attributes to be controlled
# by the *.cc pattern in the root .gitattributes file, but itâ€™s named with a
# .cpp extension instead. This file needs to be built with VC++6, a vintage 1998
# compiler, which might not understand .cc to mean C++.  Rather than setting
# attributes globally for .cpp files, which are undesirable (.cc should be used
# in its place), provide a file-specific mapping here.
