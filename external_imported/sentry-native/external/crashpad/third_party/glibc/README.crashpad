Description:
glibc is the GNU Projectâ€™s implementation of the C standard library.

Local Modifications:
 - Only elf/elf.h is included. Its #include of <features.h> has been removed,
   and it uses of __BEGIN_DECLS and __END_DECLS have been replaced with inline
   versions in the manner that misc/sys/cdefs.h defines those macros.
