Description:
A public domain implementation of getopt.

Local Modifications:
 - Minor compilation fixes applied for Windows.
 - NO_ARG, REQUIRED_ARG, and OPTIONAL_ARG were renamed to the more traditional
   no_argument, required_argument, and optional_argument for source
   compatibility with BSD and glibc getopt_long().
 - Add copy of copyright (Public domain) to the top of both files for Chromium's
   checklicenses step.
 - Compiled as .cc, and wrapped in namespace crashpad.
 - memcmp() -> strncmp() in getopt.cc to make ASan happier about some string
   manipulation.
